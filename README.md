# Legezt Web

This repository contains a simple skeleton for a multimedia web application.

It demonstrates a landing page with a splash logo, a sidebar menu and
sections for music, video, images and PDFs. Each section includes placeholder
search fields so new features can be hooked up easily.

See `index.html`, `style.css` and `script.js` for basic usage.

Run `make serve` and open <http://localhost:8000> in your browser to view the
site. The search boxes and players are purely demonstrative and can be
extended with real API calls.

## Makefile

Run `make serve` to start a local development server on port 8000. The `make help` command lists available targets.
